Everywhere we go, we're looking for the sun.  


Oh, nowhere left to go.  
Are we getting closer, closer?  
No. All we know is No.  
Nights are getting colder, colder  
Hey. Tears all fall the same.  
We all feel the rain.  
We can't change.  
Everywhere we go, we're looking for the sun.  
Nowhere to grow old. We're always on the run.  
They say we'll rot in hell, but I don't think we will.  
They've branded us enough. Outlaws of love.  


Scars make us who we are.  
Hearts and homes are broken, broken.  
Far, we could go so farï¼Œwith our minds wide open, open.  
Hey. Tears all fall the same.   
We all feel the rain.  
We can't change.  
Everywhere we go, we're looking for the sun.  
Nowhere to grow old. We're always on the run.  
They say we'll rot in hell, well I don't think we will.  
They've branded us enough. Outlaws of love.
